All contributes are very welcome, you can also use C++ if you want, but please respect these rules:

1. Keep in UTF-8 encoding
2. Keep code readable
3. Follow the C17 standard (or maybe C2X), get your copy of C17 here (last draft, should be identical with the official one but it's free)

4. Be pedantic
5. Functions have to be in this format:
// Return type on the same row as opening brackets and func name
// No space before and after args, underscore case
int main(char some_arg) {
    // 4 spaces = 1 tab
    char* pointer; // Pointer's * left align
}
